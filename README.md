# Dark Souls Save Files Manager

This is just a C# clone of http://speedsouls.com/SpeedSouls_-_Save_Organizer

I wrote it to add some function I want.

First day to use C#, all codes in one class but works fine. Please don't try it under any possible edge case.

Not support Dark Souls II now.
